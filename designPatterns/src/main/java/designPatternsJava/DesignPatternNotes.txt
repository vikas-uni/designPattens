OO Principles:
- Encapsulate what varies
- Favour composition over inheritence
- Program to interface not implementations
- strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Depend on abstraction, don't depend on concrete classes
- principal of least knowledge, call immediate methods only, e.g- ref.abc() rather than ref.abc().def()
