//Java code to demonstrate
//bridge design pattern

/**
 * The Bridge design pattern allows you to separate the abstraction from the
 * implementation. It is a structural design pattern.
 * 
 * There are 2 parts in Bridge design pattern :
 * 
 * Abstraction Implementation This is a design mechanism that encapsulates an
 * implementation class inside of an interface class.
 * 
 * The bridge pattern allows the Abstraction and the Implementation to be
 * developed independently and the client code can access only the Abstraction
 * part without being concerned about the Implementation part. The abstraction
 * is an interface or abstract class and the implementer is also an interface or
 * abstract class. The abstraction contains a reference to the implementer.
 * Children of the abstraction are referred to as refined abstractions, and
 * children of the implementer are concrete implementers. Since we can change
 * the reference to the implementer in the abstraction, we are able to change
 * the abstraction�s implementer at run-time. Changes to the implementer do not
 * affect client code. It increases the loose coupling between class abstraction
 * and it�s implementation.
 * 
 * Elements of Bridge Design Pattern
 * 
 * Abstraction � core of the bridge design pattern and defines the crux.
 * Contains a reference to the implementer. Refined Abstraction � Extends the
 * abstraction takes the finer detail one level below. Hides the finer elements
 * from implemetors. Implementer � It defines the interface for implementation
 * classes. This interface does not need to correspond directly to the
 * abstraction interface and can be very different. Abstraction imp provides an
 * implementation in terms of operations provided by the Implementer interface.
 * Concrete Implementation � Implements the above implementer by providing the
 * concrete implementation.
